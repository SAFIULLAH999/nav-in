## üîß Integration Requirements

### Environment Variables Needed
```env
# Cloudinary for media
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Email service
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password

# Redis for caching
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Elasticsearch (optional)
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200
```

### Dependencies to Install
```bash
# Backend
npm install --save \
  cloudinary \
  multer \
  nodemailer \
  bull \
  ioredis \
  pdf-parse \
  mammoth

# Frontend  
npm install --save \
  @tiptap/react \
  @tiptap/starter-kit \
  react-dropzone \
  react-player
```

## üìä Database Migration

To apply the new schema:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push to database
npx prisma db push

# Or create migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_linkedin_features
```

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **Content Moderation**: All user-generated content goes through moderation queue
2. **Rate Limiting**: API keys have configurable rate limits
3. **Anonymous Data**: Salary and interview data can be submitted anonymously
4. **Verification**: Certifications and licenses can be verified by admins
5. **Privacy**: Users control visibility of recommendations and profile data

## üìà Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Components load data on demand
2. **Pagination**: All list endpoints support pagination
3. **Caching**: Frequent queries cached in Redis
4. **CDN**: Static assets served from CDN
5. **Image Optimization**: Cloudinary automatic optimization

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track these KPIs to measure feature adoption:

- Recommendations given/received
- Certifications added
- Salary insights submitted
- Interview experiences shared
- Profile completion rate
- User engagement time
- Content moderation efficiency

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Update the database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Create API routes in `backend/src/routes/`
3. Build frontend components in `components/`
4. Add tests for new functionality
5. Update this documentation

## üìù Notes

- All new features are fully TypeScript typed
- Backend uses Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- Frontend uses Next.js 14 with React Server Components where applicable
- Authentication middleware required for protected routes
- All dates stored in UTC, converted to local time in UI
